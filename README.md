# ArduinoCyanoTimer
Arduino code for a simple timer controlling 2 relays : 
- #1 to control anything you want (I use it to control an UV lamp used for cyanotype process). Take care of the voltage and current ! Relay modules used can handle 220V AC and 10A or 30V DC and 10A. I won't take any responsibility of any damage if you plug a 2500W heater (or for any other bad idea)
- #2 to control a venting system used to cool the lamp if temperature is greater than 30Â°C

FAQ :
Q : Why didn't use the timer_0, timer_1 and timer_2 instead of reiventing wheel ?
R : Less code for same result. I don't need precision lower than 1 second, so it's OK

Q : I don't have a temperature sensor module and don't want to use it
R : Connect the digital pin 7 of the Arduino to GND. It will disable the functionality in code
