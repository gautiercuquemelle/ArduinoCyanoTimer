# ArduinoCyanoTimer
Arduino code for a simple timer controlling 2 relays : 
- #1 to control anything you want (I use it to control an UV lamp used for cyanotype process). Take care of the voltage and current ! Relay modules used can handle 220V AC and 10A or 30V DC and 10A. I won't take any responsibility of any damage if you plug a 2500W heater (or for any other bad idea)
- #2 to control a venting system used to cool the lamp if temperature is greater than 30Â°C

Used Libraries :
- LiquidCrystal_I2C : https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C

Component list :
- 1 x Arduino Uno R3
- 1 x 16x2 LCD display with I2C (I used one from iHaospace with PCF8574T chipset). Address used in code will vary depending of the chipset : read the specs !
- 1 x Double realay module (Yizhet 5V relay module with Songle SRD-05VDC relays)
- 1 x Temperature and humidity sensor module (KY-015 DHT)
- 8 x Resistor 10kOhm
- 4 x push buttons
- 4 x capacitor 10 nF
- 2 x NPN transistor (2n3906)
- 1 x prototype board
- wires, box, soldering iron, patience and good music

Schema :
- will come soon

FAQ :
Q : Why didn't use the timer_0, timer_1 and timer_2 instead of reiventing wheel ?
R : Less code for same result. I don't need precision lower than 1 second, so it's OK

Q : I don't have a temperature sensor module and don't want to use it
R : Connect the digital pin 7 of the Arduino to +VCC. It will disable the functionality in code (measure and display)
